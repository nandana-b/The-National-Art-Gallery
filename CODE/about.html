        <div class="about"><p>Over the course of its remarkable history, The National Art Gallery has been an active participant in the Middle Eastern
            art scene for almost forty years. It has had the privilege of observing and being part of the significant changes that have 
            taken place within the regional art community. Originally known as Ornina and established in 1987, the gallery initially 
            operated as an exhibition space situated above a small bookstore in Homs, Syria. It served as a vital meeting point for 
            intellectuals, critics, and artists of that era. In 1995, The National Art Gallery relocated to a modest villa in Jumeirah, 
            Dubai, where it continued to promote Arab Modernism while also fostering critical discussions that had shaped its early 
            years. Notable exhibitions during this formative period featured artists who have since become esteemed Arab masters, such 
            as Fateh Moudarres, Dia Azzawi, Paul Guiragossian, and Ismail Fattah.</p> <br>
            <p>Since 2012, The National Art Gallery has actively participated in numerous international and regional art fairs, 
            showcasing its artists' works at renowned events like Art Basel, FIAC, Frieze, Independent Brussels, The Armory Show, 
            Liste, miart, Art Dubai, Artissima, and many others. Additionally, the gallery's artists have been featured in esteemed 
            institutions and biennials such as Artpace, CCA Wattis, Gwangju Biennial, Istanbul Biennial, Manifesta, MAXXI, 
            New Museum Triennial, Palais de Tokyo, SÃ£o Paulo Biennial, SALT, Seoul Museum of Art, Smithsonian Institute, Whitechapel, 
            and Venice Biennale. The impressive list of collecting institutions that have acquired artworks from The National 
            Art Gallery includes the British Museum, Devi Art Foundation, LACMA, Metropolitan Museum of Art, MoMA, Centre Pompidou, 
            Queensland Art Gallery, Kadist Art Foundation, M+ Hong Kong, and the Tate Modern.</p></div>
